This is the collection of files and a demonstration for my Face Detection Machine Learning project. All augmented images and labels are included in the extras files 

This is the basis for my contactless checkout project where I learnt how to use machine learning and different frameworks to detect a face. 

Using the VGG16 convolution network, or both the classification and regression model I used 2 classes with a ReLU activation for a Dense layer of 2048 and a Sigmoid activation for a Dense layer of 1. Due to the processing time required, the model for trained for only 10 epoches. This caused a high loss to occur and the results aren't very accurate. However, this demonstrates the basic idea behind convolutional neural networks.
